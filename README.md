This is the vHook / Barbossa interal CS:GO hack for macOS or OSX
Created by @vikingtiger and edited and improved by me

You will need XCode to compile this hack, and osxinj (https://github.com/scen/osxinj) to inject it.

To inject it:
1) Download the latest release or use your own release.
2) Compile it
3) Type " ./osxinj csgo_osx64 libMicrowave.lib " in Terminal
4) You should see pink text in top left corner. If you can see it, you have done it right. If not, go back to step 1.
